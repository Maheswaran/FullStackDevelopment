This repository contains excel sheet which has list of frameworks, tools and technologies used in full stack development using Microsoft stack. Now a days, Being a .Net full stack developer, one must know wide variety of frameworks and tools. And there are lot of tools, frameworks and libraries are rolled out into the market every da, it difficult for any one to know and learn everything.

      ii. server side programming
  b. Back end
      i. Business Logic implementation
      ii. OR Mapping frameworks

      i.  Tools 
      ii. infrastructure
  f. Cloud Computing
      i. MS Azure services

This could help to track and understand what technologies are popular and being used in market currently. I have tagged sub items in each category into following classification, so you can decide what to learn and what to skip.

  a. Must have
  b. Good to have
  c. Nice to have
Note: Depends on your experience, roles and responsibilities, the list of "Must have", "Good to have" may vary. you may not have to learn everything. For example if your are junior programmer, then you don't have learn very advanced concepts and practices.
